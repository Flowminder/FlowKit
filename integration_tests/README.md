# FlowKit Integration Tests

This folder contains tests which use a complete FlowKit system.

## Running the Tests

The integration test suite uses docker-compose, and pytest to respectively create the test environment, and run the tests. 

To run the tests, you should first run `docker-compose up`, in this directory. This will pull all necessary docker images, and start the containers. The API will start on port 9090 of localhost.

We recommend using [Pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org) to run the tests, and a Pipfile and Pipfile.lock are included in this directory. With Pipenv you can simply do:

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv run pytest
```

to run the test suite.

If you are using an alternative environment manager, you should install the small number of packages listed in the Pipfile before running pytest.

The test suite makes use of a `.env` file, found in this directory. The values in this `.env` are used both by the test suite, and to create the docker containers. `docker-compose` will make use of the `.env` automatically, but you may need to explicitly supply the values if you are using a different method to spin up containers.

`pytest-dotenv` is used to load the `.env` for the test suite.
