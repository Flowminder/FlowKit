## What is FlowKit ?

FlowKit is a platform for analysis of Call Detail Records (CDR) and other data. CDR data is created by mobile network operators (MNOs) primarily for generating subscriber bills and settling accounts with other carriers.

FlowKit is designed to extend CDR data analysis to meet many other applications beyond billing. Some examples include disaster response, precision epidimiology and transport and mobility, more examples can be found here.

CDRs constitute a highly sensitive data set, so FlowKit is designed with privacy protection in mind. It includes the FlowAuth framework to enable fine grained authorization with extensive access logging, making it an important tool for deployment of a GDPR compliant CDR analysis system.
