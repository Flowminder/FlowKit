### Removed

## [0.6.4]

### Added

- Buttons to copy token to clipboard and download token as file added to token list page. [#704](https://github.com/Flowminder/FlowKit/issues/704)

### Fixed

- The `FLOWDB_DEBUG` environment variable used to have no effect. This has been fixed. [#811](https://github.com/Flowminder/FlowKit/issues/811)

- A new function `plot_dependency_graph()` has been added which allows to conveniently plot and visualise a dependency graph for use in Jupyter notebooks (this requires IPython and pygraphviz to be installed) [#786](https://github.com/Flowminder/FlowKit/issues/786)

### Changed

- Parameter names in `flowmachine.connect()` have been renamed as follows to be consistent with the associated environment variables [#728](https://github.com/Flowminder/FlowKit/issues/728):

### Fixed

## [0.5.2]

### Fixed

## [0.5.1]

### Added

- Added `HandsetStats` to FlowMachine.
- Added new `ContactReferenceLocationStats` query class to FlowMachine.
- A new zmq message `get_available_dates` was added to the flowmachine server, along with the `/available_dates`
  endpoint in flowapi and the function `get_available_dates()` in flowclient. These allow to determine the dates
  that are available in the database for the supported event types.

### Changed

- FlowMachine's debugging logs are now from a single logger (`flowmachine.debug`) and include the submodule in the submodule field instead of using it as the logger name
- FlowMachine's query run logger now uses the logger name `flowmachine.query_run_log`

  In addition, `flowdb_testdata` contains sample data for DFS transactions.
- The docs now include three worked examples of CDR analysis using FlowKit.
- Flowmachine now supports calculating the total amount of various DFS metrics (transaction amount,
  commission, fee, discount) per aggregation unit during a given date range. These metrics are also
  exposed in FlowAPI via the query kind `dfs_metric_total_amount`.

### Changed

- The JSON structure when setting queries running via flowapi or the flowmachine server has changed:
  query parameters are now "inlined" alongside the `query_kind` key, rather than nested using a separate `params` key.
  Example:
  - previously: `{"query_kind": "daily_location", "params": {"date": "2016-01-01", "aggregation_unit": "admin3", "method": "last"}}`,
  - now: `{"query_kind": "daily_location", "date": "2016-01-01", "aggregation_unit": "admin3", "method": "last"}`
- The JSON structure of zmq reply messages from the flowmachine server was changed.
  Replies now have the form: `{"status": "[success|error]", "msg": "...", "payload": {...}`.

  This can now be disabled by setting the environment variable `FLOWKIT_INTEGRATION_TESTS_DISABLE_AUTOSTART_SERVERS=TRUE`.
- The integration tests now use the environment variables `FLOWAPI_HOST`, `FLOWAPI_PORT` to determine how to connect to the flowapi server.
- A new data generator has been added to the synthetic data container which supports more data types, simple disaster simulation, and more plausible behaviours as well as increased performance

### Changed

  - `DB_PASS` -> `FLOWDB_PASS`
  - `DB_PW` -> `FLOWDB_PASS`
  - `API_DB_USER` -> `FLOWAPI_DB_USER`
  - `API_DB_PASS` -> `FLOWAPI_DB_PASS`
  - `FM_DB_USER` -> `FLOWMACHINE_DB_USER`
  - `FM_DB_PASS` -> `FLOWMACHINE_DB_PASS`
