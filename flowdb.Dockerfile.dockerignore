# This .dockerignore file follows the "whitelisting" approach described here:
#    https://youknowfordevs.com/2018/12/07/getting-control-of-your-dockerignore-files.html

#
*

#
# Now un-exclude only those folders and files that are needed for building the image:
#
!flowdb/Pipfile
!flowdb/Pipfile.lock
!flowdb/bin/build/
!flowdb/data/
