class Circle:

    This is a simple class for storing information about the location and
    extent of a circle - this could represent the extent of a city. It is to be used in conjuction
    with the Circle class in order to for a set of geometries that represent the circles in question.

    Parameters
    ----------
    lon, lat : int
        The longitude and latitude of the circle centre
    radius : float
        The radius in meters to use as the extent of the circle
    names : str
        An ID string for the circle

    Examples
    --------
    >>> c = Circle(2, 3, 4, 'bob')

    >>> c
