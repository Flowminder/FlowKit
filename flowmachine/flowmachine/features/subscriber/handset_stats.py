class HandsetStats(SubscriberFeature):
    """
    This class calculates statistics associated with numeric fields of the TAC
    table, such as width, height, etc.

    A subscriber might use different phones for different periods of time. In
    order to take the different usage periods into account we must calculate
    weighted statistics of the desired characteristics. As such, here we
    calculate the weighted characteristic, weighted by the number of seconds a
    subscriber held that handset.  Given that we only learn about changes in
    handset when an event occurs, this average will be biased.  For instance,
    if a subscriber changes his handset straight after an event occur, we will
    be tracking the handset that the subscriber used to handle the event and
    not the handset he actually switched to. We will only learn about the new
    handset once a new event occurs.

    We further assume that the handset held before the first observed event in
    the series is equal to the handset of the first event. Likewise, we assume
    that the handset held after the last observed event in the series is the
    handset of the last event.

    Parameters
    ----------
    characteristic: {"width", "height", "depth", "weight", "display_width", "display_height"}
        Numeric handset characteristics present in the TAC table.
    statistic : Statistic, default Statistic.SUM
        Defaults to sum, aggregation statistic over the durations.
    subscriber_handsets: flowmachine.features.subscriber_tacs.SubscriberHandsets
        An instance of SubscriberHandsets listing the handsets associated with
        the subscribers during the period of observation.

    Examples
    --------

        subscriber_handsets=SubscriberHandsets("2016-01-01", "2016-01-08"))
