    Represents the percentage of calls (or other phone events) that
    a subscriber make/receives which are at night. The definition of night
    is configurable.

    Parameters
    ----------
    start : str
        iso format date range for the beginning of the time frame,
        e.g. 2016-01-01 or 2016-01-01 14:03:01
    stop : str
        As above
    hours : tuple of ints, default (20, 4)
        Hours that count as being nocturnal. e.g. (20,4)
        will be the times after 8pm and before 4 am.
    subscriber_identifier : {'msisdn', 'imei'}, default 'msisdn'
        Either msisdn, or imei, the column that identifies the subscriber.
    subscriber_subset : str, list, flowmachine.core.Query, flowmachine.core.Table, default None
        If provided, string or list of string which are msisdn or imeis to limit
        results to; or, a query or table which has a column with a name matching
        subscriber_identifier (typically, msisdn), to limit results to.
