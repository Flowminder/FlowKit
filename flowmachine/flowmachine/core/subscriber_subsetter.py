    anything about the subsetting logic or implementation and can use any
    of these classes completely interchangeably, no matter what kind
    of subset is required or whether any subsetting is needed at all.

    If we didn't have this class then external code would need to make
    a case distinction to check if subsetting is needed, which leads
    to coupling between unrelated parts of the code base, unnecessary
    complexity and makes testing of all possible cases much difficult.
