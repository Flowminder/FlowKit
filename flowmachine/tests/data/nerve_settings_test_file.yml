# List the tables that you have that contain location data for a user
# This is any table that has a user column such as msisdn or IMEI
# Together with a location_id column. It will assume that these tables
# live in the events schema.

location_tables:
  - calls
  - sms

# Any table that contains a msisdn column which we can use to identify
# a user. This is often the same set of tables as the location tables,
# but there are some cases where we get datasets that are only information
# about a user without spatial data, such as in Nepal.

user_tables:
  - calls
  - sms

# Logging settings
# log_level may be one of ERROR, INFO, or DEBUG in ascending order of
# verbosity, and governs which messages get printed to the console.
# log_file, if given, will log error messages one detail level *higher*
# to the provided file. So, log_level: 'ERROR' will print only error
# messages, but combining that with log_file: 'debug.log' will write
# informational messages to debug.log in addition to errors.

log_settings:
  log_level: 'CRITICAL'
  log_file: ''
