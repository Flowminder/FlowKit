Title: Administrator

This section contains information for those who are managing or deploying FlowKit installations to run a humanitarian DaaS system to allow others to safely access insights while protecting individual level data.

The [deployment](deployment.md) section provides instructions for deploying full or partial FlowKit installations in multiple usage scenarios, and the management sections gives detail on the effective administration of a FlowKit deployment as well as instructions for loading data into the system using the integrated [FlowETL tool](management/etl/etl.md).
