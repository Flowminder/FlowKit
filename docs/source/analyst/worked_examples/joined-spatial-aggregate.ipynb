    "This worked example demonstrates using [joined spatial aggregate](../../../flowclient/flowclient/client/#joined_spatial_aggregate) queries in FlowKit. A joined spatial aggregate query calculates a metric for each subscriber, and joins the metric values to subscribers' locations before aggregating the metric by region.\n",

Radius of gyration is a measure of the spread of a subscriber's event locations - a subscriber with a large radius of gyration will have events spread over a larger area (for example, somebody who commutes over a long distance or regularly travels to regions away from their home).  \n",
