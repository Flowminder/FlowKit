Title: Worked examples

# Worked examples

We have five worked examples of using FlowKit for CDR analysis:

- [Flows Above Normal](./flows-above-normal/) (using FlowClient),
- [Commuting Patterns](./commuting-patterns/) (using FlowClient),
- [Total Network Objects](./total-network-objects/) (using FlowClient),
- [Unique Subscriber Counts](./unique-subscriber-counts/) (using FlowClient),
- [Mobile Data Usage](./mobile-data-usage/) (using FlowMachine).

The Jupyter notebooks for these worked examples can be found [here](https://github.com/Flowminder/FlowKit/tree/master/docs/source/worked_examples/).

Alternatively you can run the worked examples using the [quick start setup](../install.md#quickinstall) which includes JupyterLab.
