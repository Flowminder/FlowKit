Title: Worked examples

# Worked examples

We have three worked examples of using FlowKit for CDR analysis:
- [Flows Above Normal](./flows/) (using FlowClient),
- [Commuting Patterns](./commuting-patterns/) (using FlowClient),
- [Mobile Data Usage](./mobile-data-usage/) (using FlowMachine).

The Jupyter notebooks for these worked examples can be found [here](https://github.com/Flowminder/FlowKit/tree/master/docs/source/worked_examples/).
