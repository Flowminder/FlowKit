# Documentation

FlowKit's documentation is built using [Mkdocs](http://mkdocs.org).

## Build

### Requirements

- Docker
- Pipenv

To build the docs, first install the necessary dependencies by running `pipenv install` (in the `docs/` subfolder). Once this completes, you can build the docs by running `pipenv run build`.

This will create any necessary Docker containers, run all notebooks, generate markdown for the APIs, and finally build all the resulting markdown to HTML. Built docs will be in the `flowkit-docs` directory.

For local development, you can also run `pipenv run serve`, which will build the docs, and then start a live reloading web server. You can view the docs at http://localhost:8000, and any changes you make to markdown files in the `build` directory will be reflected immediately.

### Editing

To edit the docs, you should make changes to the `source` directory.

While editing, you can use `pipenv run serve` to get an automatically rebuilding and reloading version of the docs, by default accessible at http://localhost:8000.

### Build Process

The `build.sh` script:

1. If not on CircleCI, runs docker-compose to bring up a redis container, and the FlowDB testdata container on ports `9998` and `9999`.
2. Copies the content of `source` to `build` (to avoid including the markdown generated from notebooks in commits)
3. Copies the readme files from the root, flowdb and flowmachine directories to build
4. Uses `nbconvert` on all notebooks found in `build/analyst/notebooks` and writes the resulting markdown to `build/analyst`
5. Generates markdown API documentation for FlowMachine at `build/analyst/api`
6. Generates markdown API documentation for FlowClient at `build/analyst/client`
7. Builds HTML from the markdown using mkdocs

### Notes

#### nbconvert

By default, Pandas output is as HTML tables, which don't get styled nicely in the resulting markdown.  To avoid this, a modified nbconvert executor (`ExecuteWithPreamble`), from the [nbconvert-utils](https://pypi.org/project/nbconvert-utils/) package is used to inject the [pandas_to_markdown.py](/pandas_to_markdown.py) script at the start of each notebook, and hide that cell from the markdown. This makes pandas output appear as markdown tables, which then get rendered nicely by mkdocs.

#### API Documentation

Because `sphinx` does not have a markdown builder, the API documentation is generated using [mktheapidocs](https://github.com/greenape/mktheapidocs), which produces markdown from numpy formatted docstrings and uses [numpydoc](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io) for parsing.

#### Notebooks

In addition to markdown files, Jupyter notebooks can be used. Any notebooks present in the docs directory will be executed and converted automatically as part of the build process.

#### Diagrams

In addition to code blocks, you can also include [mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io) diagrams in documentation pages, by enclosing the diagram in a code block:

```markdown

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A-->B;
    A-->C;
    B-->D;
    C-->D;
```

```
